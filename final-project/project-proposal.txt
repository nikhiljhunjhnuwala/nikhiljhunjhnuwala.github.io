Final project proposal

Note: If I have extra time, I'll build additional modules.
 
Goal: Help users compare plans and decide which one is best for them. 

Background: 
-Our current design stacks 3 plan boxes on top of each other and require the user to scroll to see all their options. 
-It's easier to compare options if you can see both at the same time. 
-We have not changed the design for over 1 year.


Hypothesis: Displaying all plan options on a single screen will help the user compare plans.

Metric: View plans to sign up conversion rate

Functional Requuirements:

-present 3 plans
-js interactivity
